# Monopostat

The first and currently only goal of this software is to calculate, for each space on the Monopoly board, the probability that a player will be on that space at any given turn, and also the average number of times that space will have been visited by that turn.
This calculation is possible because player movement in Monopoly is almost entirely up to chance. The only controlable factor is how long one spends in jail, which Monopostat will assume is always one turn (at least for now).
